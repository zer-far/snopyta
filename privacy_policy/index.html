    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


    <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection and use of data when you use a service provided by
        us.</p>
    <p>We use your data only to provide our service. No data will ever be shared.</p>

    <h2><b>Scope</b></h2>
    <p>The following privacy policy is valid for all listed services on the following website:</p>
    <a href="https://snopyta.org">https://snopyta.org</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Additional privacy policies extensions per service can be found below.</p>

    <h2><b>Controller</b></h2>
    <p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>

    <p class="card-text unselectable">
        <b>Noah Seefried</b> <br>
        Am RÃ¶sgraben 9<br>
        91567 Herrieden<br>
        Germany<br>
        legal@snopyta.org
    </p>

    <h2><b>Definitions</b></h2>
    Definitions as described in Article 4(1,2) GDPR:
    <p>
        'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
    </p>
    <p>
        'processing' means any operation on personal date such as collection, recording, organisation,
        structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
        dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction
    </p>

    <h2><b>Personal data we process and collect</b></h2>

    <p>
        When you visit our website and services, your IP address and user agent are automatically processed by our web
        server.
        This is technically always necessary. Then, our server needs your IP address to send responses (e.g. website
        content) to your browser.
        By default, we do not process any other personal data of you.

        The legal basis for the processing your IP address and user agent is Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. Our legitimate
        interest is to provide our content if you want to access it.
    </p>

    <h4>Session identifiers</h4>
    <p>
        While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your computer that your software uses to
        prove your authentication state.
        This is erased immediately after you log out or the session expires. We do not use these identifiers to track
        your visit or evaluate how you use the services provided by us. <br>
        We do not use any third party cookies or tracking of any kind.
    </p>

    <h4>Logging</h4>
    <p>
        By default, no identifiable data such as IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.
        To fix problems or stop attacks, it may be necessary to temporarily store access or error logs. If this is the
        case we store data such as but not limited to a timestamp, your IP, your useragent and the URL you access.
        The data collected is kept for as long as is necessary to resolve the problem, but for a maximum of 24 hours.

        This is different for the email server! Full maillogs (they include IP address and maybe other informations like
        your client)
        are kept for 24 hours. This is needed to prevent abuse (spam, malware) and to get aware of issues with remote
        mailservers (bounces, blacklisting).
    </p>

    <h4>E-Mail Support</h4>
    <p>
        The content and the fact of any mail will not be connected to any of your accounts expect you tell us in an
        email which account you are using.
        We periodically delete old requests that are closed (at the latest after one year).
    </p>

    <h4>Registration data</h4>
    <p>
        When you register an account with us, we collect and process certain personal data from you as your registration
        data.
        For example we need your username or mail address to allocate data. You can either delete your user account on
        the respective service
        or by writing us an email to support@snopyta.org with your deletion request.
        The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Storage of collected information</b></h2>
    <p>
        All of your data is stored in a secure data center by Hetzner Online in Helsinki (Finland) or
        Nuremberg/Falkenstein (Germany).
        We strongly suggest encrypting as much as possible client side for your privacy.
    </p>

    <h4>Encryption</h4>
    <p>
        We try to encrypt things where it is possible. Most machines have full disk encryption while some of them are
        not fully encrypted.
        Next to this we encrypt as much as the respective services allow.
    </p>

    <h4>We do not share nor look into personal data</h4>
    <p>
        We retain only the bare minimum of information about each user that is required to make the service work. We do
        not sell or share any of it.
        We do not access your personal data, such as but not limited to emails, messages and files during normal
        operation. We only will do, if it is needed for troubleshooting or preventing abuse of our services. If this
        is the case, we will contacting you prior to that and ask for your permission. Once these measures have been
        completed we will be contacting you (if legally allowed) and report to you, which personal we have accessed,
        changed or otherwise
        processed.
    </p>

    <h4>Account deletion</h4>
    <p>
        You may choose to delete an account on snopyta.org at any time. Doing so will destroy all the data we retain
        that is associated with your account.
        The usernames associated with deleted accounts may remain unavailable for others to use.
    </p>


    <h2><b>Access to your information</b></h2>

    <h4>Federation</h4>
    <p>Some of the services provided by snopyta.org such as Nextcloud and Mastodon are operating based on so called
        federation protocols. This enables users signed up at different service providers to interact with each other.
        Because of the nature of the protocols (ability to send each other messages, likes, share files, chat) some of
        the data is naturally shared with other entities. However, sharing data with other service provider is the
        user's choice and is configured by the users in their settings per service including the decision of with whom
        and what to share.</p>

    <h4>Embeds and previews</h4>
    <p>You may be shown embedded videos and link previews from other websites while using services provided by
        snopyta.org. This may expose you to web tracking by external services.</p>
    <p>On our website is no third party embed unless the score pictures at <a
            href="../service/xmpp/index.html">xmpp.html</a>.</p>
