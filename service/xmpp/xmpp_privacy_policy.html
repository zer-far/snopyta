    <p>This section describes how the snopyta.org xmpp service processes your personal information internally.</p>
    <h3><span class="mw-headline"
              id="Information_Associated_with_your_Account">Information Associated with your Account</span></h3>
    <p>The following information is needed to provide the service to you (Art. 6.1b) and is stored as long as your
        account exists:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Login credentials are stored in encrypted form and never shared with other parties.</li>
        <li> Your account identifier (Jabber ID) is only shared with Jabber users and services that you interact with.
        </li>
        <li> Your contact list (roster, chatroom bookmarks) is not shared with other parties, except when you give
            explicit permission (XEP-0321: Remote Roster Management).
        </li>
        <li> Your availability information (presence) is kept in memory and automatically shared with your contacts and
            the chatrooms you enter, and might be shared with other Jabber services that you are using (e.g.
            transports).
        </li>
        <li> No IP adresses are stored by default on our servers. We may temporary enable logs which contain IP
            addresses if needed for debugging. These logs are deleted immediately after action has been taken and are
            kept for a maximum of 24 hours.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User_Content">User Content</span></h2>
    <p>Content that you send or that is sent to you, is stored on your behalf, so that you can access it from all of
        your clients (Art. 6.1b):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Messages sent to you while you are offline are stored until you connect or your account is deleted.</li>
        <li> Message archives of the messages you send and receive are stored for 15 days, if you have enabled XEP-0313:

        <li> Chatroom history is stored according to the configuration of the respective chatroom, and might be made

    </p>
    <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Online_Status">Your Online Status</span></h3>
    <p>If you join chatrooms or add other users to your contact list, those users (and the operators of their servers)
        will be automatically informed about:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> When you come online,</li>
        <li> when you go offline, and</li>
        <li> your availability status and message.</li>
